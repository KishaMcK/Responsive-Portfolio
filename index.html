              Where to start? Not sure what to put here. I'm not to well at talking about myself.
           For now I will just put a little about what I have been up to the past few years.
           I have been a mom since 2013, and a mom of two since 2014. My every day evolved 
           around making sure my boys were thirving and our home was put together. Now that my
           oldest is in school, I'm breaking out of the stay at home mom life and doing something
           for myself. After having a long sit down with my ex husband, he explained to me that I might enjoy
           being a front end web developer since I am a creative person. I decided to take his advice 
           and give it a try. Now I am hooked and I have him to thank for his full support.
